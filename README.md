# TH_SYS - TATE HANAWALT SYSTEMS

This repository was intended for system utilities and tools.

Currently this repo is hosting a bunch of different projects that are part of my rediscovered interest in providing my projects to people with package managers like brew.

Its working at the moment, if you would like to know more and try it out you can find brew installation instructions at: https://github.com/tatehanawalt/homebrew-devtools
